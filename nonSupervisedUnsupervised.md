# 🧠 Machine Learning Problems Beyond Classification and Regression

While classification and regression are key types of **supervised learning**, there are several other important machine learning problem types:

---

## 🔄 1. Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)
- **What it is**: Grouping similar data points together without labels.
- **Example**: Grouping customers into market segments based on behavior.
- **Output**: Clusters (e.g., Group A, Group B...)

---

## 🧩 2. Dimensionality Reduction (Unsupervised Learning)
- **What it is**: Simplifying data by reducing the number of features while keeping important information.
- **Example**: Using PCA to reduce 100 features down to 2 for visualization.
- **Output**: Compressed data representation.

## 🎰 3. Reinforcement Learning
- **What it is**: A model learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and getting feedback (rewards or penalties).
- **Example**: A robot learning to walk, or an AI playing chess or video games.
- **Output**: A policy or sequence of actions to maximize reward over time.

## 🔍 4. Anomaly Detection
- **What it is**: Identifying rare or unusual data points.
- **Example**: Fraud detection in banking or identifying outliers in sensor data.
- **Output**: Flagged anomalies (e.g., “normal” vs. “suspicious”)

---

## 🤖 5. Generative Modeling
- **What it is**: Models that learn to generate new data similar to the training data.
- **Example**: Generating realistic images (like deepfakes), text (like GPT!), or music.
- **Output**: Synthetic but realistic data.
