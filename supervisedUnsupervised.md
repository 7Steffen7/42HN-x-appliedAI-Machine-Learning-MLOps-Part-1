# What is the Difference Between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning?

## üß† Supervised Learning
- The model is given the **exact answers** to learn from.
- **Example**: Matching pictures of fruits with the right labels (e.g., "apple", "banana").

## üîç Unsupervised Learning
- The model **tries to find patterns** without being told the correct answers.
- **Example**: Looking at fruits and grouping similar ones together **without knowing their names**.

| **Data**             | Labeled (input + output)                    | Unlabeled (input only)                               |
| **Objective**        | Predict outcomes / classify data            | Find patterns / groupings in data                    |
| **Training**         | Learns with known answers                   | Learns from the structure of data                    |
| **Examples of Tasks**| Classification, Regression                  | Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction                 |
